### Structure
The structure required refinement on the folder structure and it's modularity. Initial creation of the folder doesn't include ReadMe, utils folder, types folder, hooks folder, components folder.

TODO:
Refine the instruction to make sure these are created as a scaffold, easier for design engineers to generate the modular component.

### Quality
Stateless primitives doesn't sit inside the module folder. Instead, it sits outside the module folder as ui folder.

Refine the instruction to make sure stateless primitives sit inside the module folder.
